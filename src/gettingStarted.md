# Getting Started

## Course Goals

In this class, each student will learn a new programming language of their choice. However, building skills in the language that you choose is only one goal of the course.

Another vitally important goal is to understand the designs, implementations, and characteristics of programming languages in general.

This means that each student's language is a kind of case study for everyone in the class. Much of our class time will be dedicated to discussion of the PLs. Before class, you must read the assigned materials and think about how they apply to your PL. In class, you will be expected to describe your PL and demonstrate code in terms of the reading concepts. You must also be a good audience, for you will be responsible for understanding and applying the findings of your classmates.

A third major course goal is to learn and apply professional practices in the development of software. The reading assignments include many guidelines and checklists of good programming practices. The programs that you write for this course will be evaluated against this ever-rising bar. You will do this through a substantial programming project.

The final goal to discuss here is independent learning. Prepare yourself for the following challenges.

* Each student will focus on a different PL, and I your instructor will not be expert in all of them.
* The topics to be covered in this class will apply to different PLs in different ways, perhaps not at all in some cases.
* The topics in this course are interrelated. No matter what order we study the concepts, we will encounter related concepts before we have studied them in detail.

## Picking Your Case-Study PL

Although you will have some choice about the PL you will study, there are some restrictions.

- Languages like HTML, CSS, XML, and SQL are not appropriate choices. These are not Turing-complete programming languages.
- Languages like Visual Studio Tools for Office and ArcGIS are not appropriate choices for first-time students. These are too closely connected with a very specialized operational environment.
- Languages like Lisp, Scheme, Haskell, ML, and Prolog are not appropriate choices for first-time students. These are fundamentally shaped by different models of computation than you have previously seen. This course includes some introduction to these alternate paradigms.
- Languages that you already know, or close variations, are not appropriate choices.

Finally, you must coordinate with your classmates to jointly select a balanced set of languages as case studies. When students list their top three choices of PL, it's usually fairly easy to come to a satisfactory arrangement. Your instructor will facilitate these discussions on the first day of class.
