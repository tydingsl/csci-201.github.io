<h1 id="chapter-31-layout-and-style">Chapter 31: Layout and Style</h1>
<p>Read <em>Code Complete</em> Chapter 31.</p>
<p>As with Chapter 33 on “Personal Character”, many students show a tendency to discount the importance of these concepts. Some cooperate by cleaning up the layout of their code after their program is complete, but this misses most of the point. You will find it easier to complete your program correctly if you maintain good layout as you go.</p>
<h2 id="layout-fundamentals">31.1 Layout Fundamentals</h2>
<p>Hopefully this section convinces you of the importance of good layout.</p>
<p>If not, look at the sidebar quote on page 735. Speaking as an experienced programmer, it is definitely true that my ability to read and understand a program is directly related to the quality of the layout and style. Each style deficiency is a distraction, and if the layout falls below “pretty good”, I have a lot more trouble. Using good layout helps me to help you.</p>
<p>That was the carrot; now for the stick. You are expected to apply good layout and style to your programming work.</p>
<h2 id="specific-layout-guidelines">31.2-31.8 Specific Layout Guidelines</h2>
<p>There is a lot of material here, and most of it is very valuable. To master this, you will need to return to it, re-read, and think about your programming work.</p>
<p>Again, McConnell is spelling out some of what it takes to be the 10x great programmer, and this kind of attention to detail is important in many other pursuits as well. What you choose to do with this is a matter of your personal character.</p>
