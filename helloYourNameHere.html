<h1 id="hello-your-name-here">Hello, &lt;your name here&gt;!</h1>
<p>After successfully writing the Hello, world! program, one likely next step is to write a program that asks the user to enter their name, then greets them by name.</p>
<p>In a console based program, the behavior might look something like this.</p>
<pre><code>Enter your name: Dave
Hello, Dave!</code></pre>
<p>The program prints a prompt, followed by a colon. The user then types their input.</p>
<p>The code to do this is probably straightforward. But depending on the PL and the environment that it runs in, there may be some complicated details involving libraries, runtime configuration, etc.</p>
